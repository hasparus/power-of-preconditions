# Preconditions

- function signature is sometimes not enough to encode all preconditions

- **return expected error states, throw on programmer mistakes**

---

```ts
function f(...args: SignatureHoldsSomePreconditions) {
  const x = someOtherCode();
  // ...
  assert(
    butMorePreconditionsExist(),
    "Hold up! My assumptions were wrong"
  );
  // ...
  return result;
} 
```

> A precondition is a condition or predicate 
> that must always be true just prior to the execution
> of some section of code.

> If a precondition is violated, the effect of the section of code
> becomes undefined and thus may or may not carry out its intended work.
